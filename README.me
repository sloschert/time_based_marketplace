# time_based_marketplace

This web app is written with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

It allows to offer goods and services locally and transparently - e.g. for local solidarity economies.

It implements a [time-based currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency). Values of goods and services are measured and displayed in time spent in production.

The app is hosted and in beta stage. Contact me if your are interested in the latest version of this app.
